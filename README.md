# Blockchain-Simulator
In this project, Designing a cryptocurrency similar to BitCoin. Then simulating a multi-user network, once a transaction is made, the user announces it to his near peers. Once the user accumulate n transaction, he can form a block by accumulating transactions and doing a computationally expensive task and append this nonce to the block. Once the block is formed, it can now be announced. After a block announcement, users who are notified about this block, will add it to their version of the ledger and the majority of them have to consent that this version of the ledger is the same version they have. Users with different version than this version will have to throw away their versions and adopt this one.
